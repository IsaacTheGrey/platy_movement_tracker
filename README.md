## Usage
Custom movement tracker that:
- takes a video of a behaviour arena,
- identifies the wells automatically,
- subtracts background (it removes everything that is staying constant between frames)
- tracks the biggest object in each well

## Ideas for further development
Maybe making the history for background subtraction longer makes it more sensitive to the actual worms moving
